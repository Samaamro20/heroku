# OSky
A portfolio about OSky team ( Moutaz-Sama-Hadeel-Fidaa ).
Why ?
We all need an exciting introduction about our personality and an exciting sentence about the nature of our work and the most modern way to highlight the work of each programmer and to demonstrate the effective characters is a simple site with introduction to the group or company.

What ?
This site is a single page in 4 sections, the main section contains a list of links to the other sections and the name of the company or group as well as an interesting sentence about the group, and the date of issuance of this site.
Â The second section contains the user scenario with a paragraph containing information about the nature of the work presented by the team,
The third section contains cards representing the image of each programmer and when the reference to each card shows some information about the programmer name, specialty, and a set of links to sites including the Github, the Codewars and the LinkedIn,
Section IV contains a form to allow anyone access to the team by sending a message,
The end bar containing copyright and links to some of the policies used in our country.

How ?
We started to meet and then we planned and determined the requirements for this site and we divided the page into several sections and distributed to the team.
